Interview Practice with Python Problems
  The first lab provides a solution for ‘Capturing Rain Water’. This solution uses a forward then backward traversal of an array to see how water would fill a space based on relative left and right max heights.
  The second lab provides a solution for the ‘Longest common subsequence’ (LCS) of a string. This is done by creating a grid that holds the lengths of all previous substrings LCS and then traversing the grid backward to find the characters of the LCS.
